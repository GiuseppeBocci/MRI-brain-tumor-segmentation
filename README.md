# MRI-brain-tumor-segmentation
This repository contains the project **segmentation of an brain lesion from MRI** produced for the Biomedical Image Analysis module of the course BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MEDICAL IMAGES taught by prof. Signorini Maria Gabriella and Augusto Bonilauri at "Politecnico di Milano" A.Y. 2023/2024.

# Goal
The aim of the project is to preprocess and segment MRI cerebral volume of a single patient affected by a brain
tumor positioned between the frontal and limbic lobes and estimate the lesion volume.
More details, methods and results can be seen [here](docs/abstract).

### workflow.m
Contains the elaboration workflow for the segmentation of the tumor and the
estimation of its volume. To see resilience to noise, it's possible to add noise by uncommenting the
dedicated section.

### workflow_manul.m
Compare the automatic and manual workflow for sagittal slice 135.
